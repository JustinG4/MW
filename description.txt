New players can choose to be in a guild or stay solo
Guilds are tied to a particular memecoin. To be in a guild, you must pay an entry fee in the memecoin that represents that guild (web3 integration - thirdweb)
    These entry fees fuel the guild’s Treasury
        The guild’s treasury is used to pay out players each week based on leaderboards
            Each week, all of the losing guilds treasuries are liquidated and added to the winning guilds treasury
            Leaderboards consist of the combined W | L for guild members (as well as ratio)
    Players individual W | L are taken into account when making payouts
The members of each guild have a unique monster
    Members level up their own personal versions of the monster
    As monsters level up they get more powerful
The map consists of the memedom and the “free cities”
The memedom and free cities are separated by water
Battles are turn-based with a quick countdown to enforce quick-thinking
Items, Artifacts, and wild mascots can be found in the map on rare occasion or purchased using the in-game currency (name TBD)
Some items are unique to certain realms
In-game currency can be earned through combat
